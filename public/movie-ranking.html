<h1>The Best Movies According to Keda</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>
  This might just be my favourite movie! Being put to prison for something you
  haven't done is just saddening but getting your part of justice at the end is
  just a wholesome thing.
</p>
<h3>Hacksaw Ridge</h3>
<p>
  This is my favourite gospel genre movie. The character played by Andrew
  Garfield in this is amazing. Imagine wanting to be in a war zone without any
  guns but to be a medic just for the zeal to save the others on the field. Even
  better, he eventually goes on to lead the army in prayer just before entering
  into the war zone. A must-watch!
</p>
<h3>Life is Beautiful</h3>
<p>
  This movie revolves around the time of the dictatorship of the Nazis over the
  Jews. A funny and loving father makes up stories for his son while they were
  held captives inorder to keep his son away from worry. He pretends to be happy
  and excited whenever he is around his son. The sacrifices a father can make
  for their children!
